Introduction

The purpose of this project is for developing self-driving vehicle by working on embedded system that can be divided into subsystems. 

As a group, we are going to follow some steps to achieve the project’s goal. Steps are:

1- Working on the project (self-driving vehicle) according to the requirements (functional and non-functional ) that are provided by the customer (Teacher) 

2- Researching for suitable algorithms that can be implemented in this project,for lane detection, lane following and being used for vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V).

3- Implementing and adapting desired algorithmes to the project and making sure that are meet the customer’s requirements.
 
4- Testing and evaluating the implemented algorithms and making sure that they are working well in the project. 

5- Finally, documenting the previous steps; hardware & software that are used, algorithms (Code) that are  implemented, test methods that are applied and project’s retrospective (e.g. lessons learned).
