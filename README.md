# DIT168-V18-Project-Industrial-IT-and-Embedded-Systems
In this project, the students design and implement an embedded system common to the entire class by dividing it into subsystems. This places high demands on the students for appropriate functional and non-functional requirements, effective design, quality assurance and testing. In addition, the project places particular demands on effective integration and interaction between the groups as well as internally within each group.
