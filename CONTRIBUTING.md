# How to contribute

The contribution process for each member of the group should be as following:

1- The group’s member clones repository to his device by using git bash (or ubuntu terminal).

2- The group’s member opens a specific file to work on depending on his specific task.

3- When the group’s member finishes his task, he makes a pull request that should be accepted by all members.

4- After accepting the pull request, the group’s member pushes his code according to the following:

A- Opening Git bash terminal.

B- Writing:  git add . (or git add A) to add all changes or new files.
C- Writing: git commit -m “(TO WRITE A COMMENT THAT DESCRIBES CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE)”.
  
D- Writing:  git push (for pushing changes into Github repository).

Note!: If the group’s member is already cloned the files, he should pull changes first (by writing: git pull on git bash terminal) for avoiding mixing up files, getting files conflict, losing newest changes or losing files. After that, the group’s member starts working from step 2 (As mentioned above).
