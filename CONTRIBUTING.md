# How to contribute to the project

Contribution to this project will occur in seperate branches, depending on the feature or bug being worked on. Each branch created will follow the same pattern, the feature name will include dashes to seperate words (such as `lane-detection`) while bug fixes should be created in seperate branches, appended by `_fix` such as `lane-detection_fix`. 

Each commit shall be made using a descriptive short summary, followed by a longer descriptive description for bigger commits, using addition symbol for addition(s) and subtraction symbol for subtraction(s) to the code, while bug fixes and refactoring will be represented using an (* asterisk). Bigger commits should be avoided however, and should be split into smaller commits to make it easier to undo changes and find issues.
